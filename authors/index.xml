      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a researcher and engineer in Artificial Intelligence with mixed academia and industry experience of about 10 years. My background cover the fields of upsupervised learning, image classification, object detection, image retrieval, recommendation, et al. Currently, I am a technical leader of computer vision in kujiale.com, which is a unicorn startup company in the field of clould computing, 3D interior design and 3D visulization.
Besides exploring the edge of artificial intelligence, I also have some interest in social sciences and humanities because of my curiosity and care of the world. Maybe I will post some of my thoughts about this topic in this website. My hobbies are sports and travel.
If you have any question about my work and me, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to make a contact.&lt;/p&gt;
