      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just spent two months&amp;rsquo; wonderful experience as a volunteer section leader in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/free-coding-education-time-covid-19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Standford Code in Place&lt;/a&gt;, which is a community-service virtual coding education program in the time of COVID-19. It is a very special and history making course with over 800 great teachers and 8000 students all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code in Place is an introductory programming course using the Python language, with material from the first half of Stanford University&amp;rsquo;s established intro course, CS106A. It is operated by some great Stanford professors and instructors. As far as I know, this is the best online course nowadays as it creates a learning community with some great ideas and tools like section, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://edstem.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ed&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://zoom.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this journey, I lead a section with 8 lovely students. Section is what makes CodeInPlace different from other online courses. It is a small learning group and sectionees meet via videoconferencing once a week with a section leader. In every section meeting, I helped consolidate students&amp;rsquo; understanding of the concepts presented in lectures and gave students the opportunity to problem-solve in an active learning setting by having them come up with the solutions with my facilitation. This is my first teaching experience and it is such a great start with so many tips and inspirations from the best instructors. I feel very enjoyable and grateful to be part of this community. Thanks for all the instructors and my lovely students. In this COVID time, it&amp;rsquo;s so special and I will definitely miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
